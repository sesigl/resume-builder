Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Once we are done, save the spec as @spec.md

Ask if the user wants to create a git repo on github. if so, commit the spec.md to git and push it to the newly created git repo.

Here’s the idea:

I want you to do proper research how to build a best in class resume with latex. your goal is to create a clean, well maintained project so that everyone can create resumes based on a few input files of: 
1. position to apply for, for that the best fitting information are taken. 
2. general infomration about strengths, weaknessess, skills that must contain examples. 
3. what jobs the person had in the past. from that using gemini CLI 

The following sections has this resume: 

1. a summary on top containing a few sentences - that's the most important part that HR reads.
2. th 2nd section a skill section, 
3. and the last section is from recent to the past a list of positions that the person had. 

create all automation needed that also tells me about missing information, which I can 
  start via CLI. Think yourself what else would be helpful to create a well working resume builder CLI.
